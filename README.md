# Artemis Financial
Artemis Financial, a financial services company, required enhanced security measures for its software application to protect sensitive data and ensure secure communication. The primary goal was to identify and mitigate software security vulnerabilities through encryption, secure communication protocols, and dependency management. The project involved implementing SHA-512 for cryptographic hashing, generating and configuring self-signed certificates to enable HTTPS, and using the OWASP Dependency-Check tool to detect and suppress false-positive vulnerabilities. One of the key successes was accurately identifying vulnerabilities and applying secure coding practices to prevent potential exploits. Secure coding is critical for protecting sensitive financial data, maintaining client trust, and ensuring regulatory compliance. Strengthening software security helps safeguard a company's reputation and prevents costly security breaches.

A challenging yet valuable aspect of the vulnerability assessment was determining which issues could be mitigated and which required suppression due to the absence of immediate fixes. Layers of security were increased by integrating encryption, enforcing HTTPS, and conducting static vulnerability scans to identify potential risks. Future assessments would involve continuous monitoring, penetration testing, and adopting updated security best practices. To ensure the refactored code was both functional and secure, thorough testing was performed, including secondary dependency checks to confirm no new vulnerabilities were introduced. The use of tools such as Java Keytool, Maven, and the OWASP Dependency-Check plugin proved invaluable, and these practices will be useful for future security-focused projects. This assignment demonstrated a structured approach to secure software development, which can serve as a strong portfolio example to showcase expertise in cybersecurity, encryption, and secure coding practices to future employers.
